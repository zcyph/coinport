A minimalist cryptocurrency tracker.

This small Python script uses the CoinGecko API to retrieve current price of specified cryptocurrency and display them.

It also retrieves information from a spreadsheet to display current holdings, dollar value, total book value, market value and profit/loss of portfolio.
